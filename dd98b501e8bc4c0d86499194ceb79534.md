### Confidence interval estinatino fo the mean
- Level of confidence is symbolized by 
$$ (1 - \alpha) \cdot 100 \% $$
- Alpha is the proportion in the tails of the distribution that is outside the confidence interval 
- the proportion in the upper tail and lower tail of the distribution is 
$$\frac {\alpha}{2}$$
- to obtain $(1 - \alpha) \cdot 100 \%$
	- 	confidence interval estimate of the mean with a known sdv
$$
\bar{x} - \Zeta \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{x} + \Zeta \cdot  \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
- where Zeta is the valiue correspinding to an area of 
$$
\frac {(1-\alpha)}{2}
$$
- from the center of the standard normal distribution 
***
- to construect a 95% confidence interval estimate of the mean, we need to select alpha = 0.05. 
- the Zeta value to an area 0.95/2 = 0.475 from the center of the standard normal distrabution is 1.96
	- zeta is the boundry line -+
	- in general, 95% confidence interval estimate is interpereted to mean that, if all possible samples is the same size n considered, 95% will include the true population mean somewhere within the interval around their sample mean, and only 5% of them do not

## Explain
n = 30 students
xbar = 3.62
mu = ? somewhere between 3 and 4
- claim that its between 3.5 and 3.7

Confidence lvl for saying its between 3 and 4 is 100%
Confidence lvl for between 3.5 and 3.7 80%/ 90%? what is it

larger interval will increase confidence, but smaller interval is desired


***
Example using above numbers
$$
\bar{x} - \Zeta \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \leq \mu \leq \bar{x} + \Zeta \cdot  \frac{\sigma}}
$$
$$
3.62 - 1.96 \cdot \frac{0.15}{\sqrt{30}} \leq \mu \leq 3.62 + 1.96 \frac{0.15}{\sqrt{30}}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
$$
3.5632 \leq \mu \leq 3.67368
$$
with 95% confidence (from image 0.475 = .95/2 for each half)
reverse z- table lookup. convert 0.475 to 1.96.  

***
## Exer 8.1 

xbar = 8.5
n = 64
sigma = 8
CL (condifence level) = 95%

alpha = 1- CL = 5%

z = 1.96 if cl = 95% (last problem)


$$
8.5 - 1.96 \cdot \frac{8}{\sqrt{64}} \leq \mu \leq 8.5 + 1.96 \frac{8}{\sqrt{64}} \newline
83.04 \leq \mu \leq 86.96
$$

this is a thing?
